#Project Archon

This is an experimental tool for creating interactive instructional videos.

Several amazing web libraries do most of the heavy lifting for this project:
[d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/)
[backbone.js and underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
[vimeo api](https://github.com/vimeo/player-api)
